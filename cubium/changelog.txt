Version: 1.0.21
Date: 5. 11. 2025
  Major Features:
   - Fixed carbon inversion icon.
   - Anger cracking - Gives more fear, less anger. 
   - anger-reconstitution - Gives less anger back. This ensures disgust won't clog up as much.
   - New recipe - hope spoilage. Combine hope and disgust to make spoilage. This process is so peverse it can take a sleppy cube and wake it up.
   - Swapped icons for many cubic recipes (engine unit, sulfuric acid inversion, petrol gas by inversion, light oil by inversion)
   - New technology dream holmium plate. Unlocked with 20000 science packs, including promethium science. 
   - Aquilo start - dream holmium can be unlocked for 500 science packs, after cube mastery 3.
   - Aquilo start - EM plants reverted back to their original recipe. 
   - Autoplace control for coal fixed
   - New recipes - angry ammunition, solid-fuel from hope and dream. 
   - fixed railgun turret localization and changed category to cubic
   - New recipe EM plant ex dream
   - Anger reconstitution icon changed so it is now distinct form anger cracking
   - Angry rockets recipe icon changed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.20
Date: 5. 10. 2025
  Major Features:
   - Aquilo start. Lithium recipe altered. No longer uses holmium plates. This was an oversight on my part - forgot you needed holmium. Now you don't have to wander the ammonia seas looking for icebergs to harvest
   - Aquilo start - new recipe. Heat pipe breeding. Raises more questions than answers, but should make the early game go faster.
   - Dream advanced circuit and dream processing unit recipe icons - swapped cloud and circuit board between front and back. Recipes remain unchanged.
   - Aquilo version of inverted-shards recipes - energized-shards get 190 back (same), ignored by productivity now 188. Sure you can eek out more cubes by smashing them. But that isn't really the point of the challenge. 
   - If you want more cubes - make a friend. Or have him join your LAN, drop his cubes and starting materials, then disappear. All players get 100 cubes. 
   - Aquilo start - Foundry technology locked behind turbo-transport-belt-dream research. To help players understand they have to get tungsten by recycling turbo belts
   - Aquilo start - Stack inserter and transport belt cpacity one moved to Aquilo. Transport belt capacity 2 remains a Gleba tech
   - Reasoning - Pretty fair to move it Aquilo for this gamemode. Unique starting scenario is one of the few times I will cannibalize vanilla features.
   - Aquilo start - 100 --> 200 heat pipes. Quality of life really. 
   - Cubium science recipes. Output increased.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - Aquilo start - Inverted cube jelly recycling gives carbon instead of stone
    - Aquilo start - Carbon fiber now craftable with cube mastery 5.
    - Ensured cube smasher recycling can't return ultradense substrate on Cubium/Aquilo starts
    - Aquilo start - Tungsten plates should be obtainable. Note that dream recipes don't alter vanilla recycling recipes.
    - Cube mastery 5 - dream foundry recipe for Aquilo. 
    - Cubium start - cube mastery 5 adjusted with dream foundry recipe
    - Aquilo start - fixed quantum processor exploit.
    - Cubium-Aquilo start - recyclers craftable
    - Cubium_Aquilo start - express/turbo belts from dream technology prerequisites moved to cube mastery
    - Turbo transport belt from dream packs - removed space and metallurgic requirement
    - Cubium Turbo transport belt dream - recipes adjusted so there are only 2 fluid inputs.

    - Aquilo start: asteroid productivity moved to Aquilo tech tree
    - Aquilo and Cubium starts: Cube can be used in furnaces and boilers. Added burnt inventory size to boilers and furnaces so you get the cube back
    - Heating tower burnt inventory size to 3.
    - Cubium start - Cube jelly basic gives 4 cube jelly over 2. This will make start move faster.
    - Cubium start - research up to sulfur processing enabled at start. This will make starting on cubium less anemic.

    - Aquilo start - starter chemical plant, solid fuel, starter ores. More solar panel, accumulator
    - Aquilo start cubium planet discovery research recursive. 
    - Cube fuel type moved to cubic and cubic fuel type now only allowed in heating tower. Boilers and red pump jack were eating cubes. I'll have to test which entities I need to give the burnt_inventory_fuel_size tag to.

    - Cube smasher selection vertical area box decreased.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.6
Date: 19. 3. 2025
  Major Features:
    - Reworked microcube recipes. It turns out the probability on result dooesn't work as how I thought. It attempts to generate an item for each result that has a probability attached to it. In practice, this means one craft can give you back both a dormant cube and an active cube. This also means you can get back nothing. In long term testing - this made some recipes generate cubes while others ate cubes. The point of using porbability in the first place was to make it easier to reuse the same cube, but this makes it more complicated when you consider unauthorized cube breeding and cube eating.
    - Space cube recovery recipe reworked with probability behavior in mind. It always shatters the cube, but costs much less.
    - Recipes for express belts with the cube and dream concentrate. Locked behind a cheap technology that requires cube mastery 4 and logistics 3 
    - Recipes for turbo transport belts with the inverted cube. Locked behind a cheap technology that requires cube mastery 4 and turbo transport belt.
    - SSub Icon shift now zero, from 140. I think it looks nicer with everything centered and the cube in the background
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.5
Date: 14. 3. 2025
  Major Features:
    - carbonic scaffolding input cost reduced. 20-12 jelly. 30->15 carbon

    - Cost of liquid dream is 4 --> 3 dream. Now 200 water, and 200 dream out. (was 100 and 100)
    - cube-jelly-to-solid-fuel now gives 2 solid fuel. 
    - cube jelly to steam now takes 7 jelly, from 4
    - Added alternative ways to craft the science packs with the cube and dream concentrate and microcubes. This should mesh well with farming biters for dream concentrate.
    - In general, these alternative recipes take the microcubecube and dream concentrate, and give double the science back from the same other ingredients! Dream big. Dream of more science
    - I ignored space science because its already easy to get a lot of it.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
