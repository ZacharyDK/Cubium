    - It is up to mod makers to add an alternate science recipe to cubium's cube-mastery-4 technology. Their choice for how they want to design it.
    - Emotional fluid icons updated. Now have cube in center of the droplet. This makes them more distinct 
    - Cubium start - oil processing not a trigger tech. Had forgot to change that one. 
    - Now possible to do an Aquilo start with Cubium installed. You get 50 microcubes and several balance changes to Cubium for Aquilo start. Note that you can't craft any more cubes - you get what you start with.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.6
Date: 19. 3. 2025
  Major Features:
    - Reworked microcube recipes. It turns out the probability on result dooesn't work as how I thought. It attempts to generate an item for each result that has a probability attached to it. In practice, this means one craft can give you back both a dormant cube and an active cube. This also means you can get back nothing. In long term testing - this made some recipes generate cubes while others ate cubes. The point of using porbability in the first place was to make it easier to reuse the same cube, but this makes it more complicated when you consider unauthorized cube breeding and cube eating.
    - Space cube recovery recipe reworked with probability behavior in mind. It always shatters the cube, but costs much less.
    - Recipes for express belts with the cube and dream concentrate. Locked behind a cheap technology that requires cube mastery 4 and logistics 3 
    - Recipes for turbo transport belts with the inverted cube. Locked behind a cheap technology that requires cube mastery 4 and turbo transport belt.
    - SSub Icon shift now zero, from 140. I think it looks nicer with everything centered and the cube in the background

    - cube-jelly-to-solid-fuel now gives 2 solid fuel. 
    - cube jelly to steam now takes 7 jelly, from 4
    - Added alternative ways to craft the science packs with the cube and dream concentrate and microcubes. This should mesh well with farming biters for dream concentrate.
    - In general, these alternative recipes take the microcubecube and dream concentrate, and give double the science back from the same other ingredients! Dream big. Dream of more science
    - I ignored space science because its already easy to get a lot of it.
