Version: 1.0.6
Date: 19. 3. 2025
  Major Features:
    - Reworked microcube recipes. It turns out the probability on result dooesn't work as how I thought. It attempts to generate an item for each result that has a probability attached to it. In practice, this means one craft can give you back both a dormant cube and an active cube. This also means you can get back nothing. In long term testing - this made some recipes generate cubes while others ate cubes. The point of using porbability in the first place was to make it easier to reuse the same cube, but this makes it more complicated when you consider unauthorized cube breeding and cube eating.
    - Space cube recovery recipe reworked with probability behavior in mind. It always shatters the cube, but costs much less.
    - Recipes for express belts with the cube and dream concentrate. Locked behind a cheap technology that requires cube mastery 4 and logistics 3 
    - Recipes for turbo transport belts with the inverted cube. Locked behind a cheap technology that requires cube mastery 4 and turbo transport belt.
    -SSub Icon shift now zero, from 140. I think it looks nicer with everything centered and the cube in the background

Version: 1.0.5
Date: 14. 3. 2025
  Major Features:
    - carbonic scaffolding input cost reduced. 20-12 jelly. 30->15 carbon
    - liquid dream recipe cost reduced. 10 to 3 dream
    - fear courage steam buffed now 5000 steam
    - ice dreams - 3 to 7 ice
    - added a cubic category, moved items and recipes there.
    - rocket fuel from dreams 10 --> 15
    - Cost of liquid dream is 4 --> 3 dream. Now 200 water, and 200 dream out. (was 100 and 100)
    - cube-jelly-to-solid-fuel now gives 2 solid fuel. 
    - cube jelly to steam now takes 7 jelly, from 4
    - Added alternative ways to craft the science packs with the cube and dream concentrate and microcubes. This should mesh well with farming biters for dream concentrate.
    - In general, these alternative recipes take the microcubecube and dream concentrate, and give double the science back from the same other ingredients! Dream big. Dream of more science
    - I ignored space science because its already easy to get a lot of it.
